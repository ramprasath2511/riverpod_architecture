# Flutter Tech Test

This repository acts as a base for the two technical stages of our Flutter Recruitment Process.

## Getting Started
- Run `fvm install` ([FVM installation steps available here](https://fvm.app/))
- Run `fvm flutter pub get`
- Run code generation: `fvm flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs`
- Create an [Imgur](https://www.pexels.com/) API key online
- Set your `PEXELS_API_KEY` in `launch.json`
- Run the app

## Stage 1

Stage 1 is all about testing your technical awareness ability, you'll notice an open pull request in the repository. Your task here is to review the pull request in full as well as the `main` branch it is pointing to.

Using your expertise and keen eye for attention to detail you will leave comments where necessary and recommend changes for the author to implement, just as you would for a peer’s pull request.

The codebase is presented as if written by a developer new to Flutter, so it is a chance for you to demonstrate your technical skills as well as how you would approach providing some feedback to a more junior member of your team.

We’d also welcome any further commentary or suggestions you might have around the codebase as a whole (including the `main` branch).  Please add these as comments on the pull request.
